## Classification Prediction Problem - Attempt 5

This is my 5th and final attempt at the classification prediction problem. In this attempt I utilized a majority of the same steps as attempt 4, but used more variables in my recipe and did not account as much for missingness. This was my best model as I got a roc_auc value in the A range.
