## Classification Prediction Problem - Attempt 1

This subdirectory holds my first attempt at the classification prediction problem. All of the tuning r-scripts as well as the model analysis and final model r-scripts. I ran 5 different model types initially. It turned out that my best model was the boosted tree model, which is what I ultimately submitted for my first attempt.
