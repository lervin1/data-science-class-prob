## Classification Prediction Problem - Attempt 2

This subdirectory holds my second attempt at the classification prediction problem. In this attempt, I wanted to try a svm poly model with a lasso based recipe as well as a tree based recipe. These models ultimately did not do as well as I wanted, so after this attempt I decided to focus my time and engergy on the boosted tree model, which was my best performing model in attempt 1.
