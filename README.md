## Classification Prediction Problem

This is the repo for the classification prediction problem competition on Kaggle. For this we are utilizing the Airbnb dataset to predict whether a host is a superhost or not. Within this directory, I have folders for each of my attempts as well as a data folder, submission folder, and figures folder in order to be organized and throrogh.
